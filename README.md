# 🏡 Real Estate Price Predictor App

A web application that predicts the price of real estate properties based on features such as location, square footage, number of bedrooms, and more. Built with **Python**, **Flask**, and **scikit-learn**, this project demonstrates a practical application of machine learning in real estate.

## 🚀 Features

- 🔮 **Price Prediction**  
  Get estimated property prices based on user input.
  
- 🤖 **Machine Learning Model**  
  Trained on real-world historical housing data using `scikit-learn`.

- 💻 **Interactive Web Interface**  
  Simple and responsive frontend built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. The user enters property details such as:
   - Location
   - Area (in square feet)
   - Number of bedrooms, bathrooms, etc.

2. The **Flask backend** receives this input and feeds it into a trained ML model.

3. The model processes the input and returns the predicted price to the user.
